This is a collection of programs I have written for my programming and machine learning courses in my Master's program and for fun. I work in PyCharm for personal projects and I use Jupyter Notebook as required for my school assignments. I have received straight As in my programming courses. 

I am still in the process of uploading my work. More will be posted soon.
